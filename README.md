# Notes about this repo:

1. I have a problem extending the matchers, js-dom got an updated, so reading the messages in odin's discord I found this: 

" I went to testing-library/jest-dom website and installed it the way it says to with Vitest instead of the way they reccomend on TOP (just saying this is what worked for me) i think it was due to the newest version of testing-library/jest-dom! and also you dont need to extend the matchers in the newest version (this is what was casuing most of the issues - unecessary imports)".

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
